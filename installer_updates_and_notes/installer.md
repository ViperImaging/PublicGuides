# Installer

We've made a few changes to our installer to enhance the functionality and ensure smooth operations. One significant addition is the integration of WinPcap, a tool that enables network packet capture on Windows platforms. Here's a step-by-step guide to walk you through the new process:

### Starting the Installer:
- As always, double-click on the **ViperVision.exe** installer that you've downloaded.
- Follow the on-screen prompts until you reach the new section about WinPcap installation.

### WinPcap Installation:
- During the installation process, you will encounter a prompt asking you to install WinPcap.
- It's essential for the optimal functionality of ViperVision, so we recommend you proceed with the installation.

### Accepting Default Settings for WinPcap:
- When the WinPcap installer starts, you will see a series of options and settings.
- To ensure the best compatibility with our software, please accept the default settings provided by the WinPcap installer.
- Click on the "Next" or "Install" button (as applicable) to continue.

### Completing the Installation:
- Once WinPcap installation is completed, the installer will continue with the installation of ViperVision.
- Follow the remaining prompts as usual.
- After the installation process is completed, click "Finish" or the relevant prompt to close the installer.
